# Track_Covid (Winner of the Hackathon)
This is the of **Track_Covid** team in the Hackathon Code_India challenge.

## About
India hasnâ€™t yet gotten into the largescale community outbreak of COVID-19 that most of Europe and USA is seeing today. The Govt. and the entire country have come together in their effort to isolate and treat the cases that have been identified so far and are being identified every day. In an effort to contribute to this cause, a cross-platform application has been developed to track the possible transmission of the Sars-cov-2 virus from an unaware infected person to other healthy people. This novel app collects travel history information from its users to create a dynamic database and correlates this database with the travel history of an infected person as soon as a fresh case is detected. This way identification of unaware affected people is speed up manifold in the incubation period of the virus.

On one hand the app would collect travel and interaction information from individuals and
subsequently compare those with information of COVID-19 affected persons uploaded by the Govt.
rapid identification of possible transmission with valid social markers would be possible. On the
other hand there wold be provisions in the app through which doctors/ concerned Govt. authorities
would be able to keep track of the increasing number of people who are in enforced quarantine or
home quarantine and those who are released from the hospitals after being cured.

## Applications
Our app is a multipurpose app which is useful for both general public and medical professionals
For general public, our app keeps them direct in touch with the medical professionals which keeps them updated on a regular basis and hence the possibility of fake news will get minimized by a great amount.
For medical professionals, the app helps them to find the persons associated with the affected person. It also helps them to identify the persons belonging directly or indirectly to the COVID Hotspot Zones declared by the Government of India. And the third application of our app is the doctors can directly share information without any third-party media.

## Datasets
For demonstrating the code we have developed a dummy dataset on different travel history.
The data can be viewed from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lNSXaSkMGSeWKM6dUoedxpvgQXHvvanr?usp=sharing.
One important thing to notice the database is dynamic in nature.

## App
For the android app visit the link https://github.com/sourajit1999/Track_COVID-19

## Python code

In the **Code** folder there are the python files . Data_Processing.py process the data which analyses the travel database and gives the medical professionals the details of the associated persons with the affected person.
